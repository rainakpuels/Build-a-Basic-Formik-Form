# Build a Basic Formik Form

# About:

[Formik] (https://formik.org/) is the world's most popular open source form library for React and React Native. In this exercise developed in the MITx Full Stack Certificate Program, we used it to build a very basic form.

# How to Run:

Fork or download the files to your local machine.

Open a command line on your computer and run the command cd path/to/project/root, which allows you to point to the root folder of the starter files (note that path/to/project/root should be replaced with the actual path to the starter files).

Within the same command-line window, run npm install to install all dependencies
Once the command completes successfully, run npm start to start the application in your browser.

# Dependencies

In order to complete the above steps, you will need to have Node V14 installed. 

# Roadmap of Future Improvemenets

This form can be improved upon, and made much more complex for future use!
